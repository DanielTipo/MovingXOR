# Diff

Compares two binary files and outputs the similarities and prints out the difference in %.

Usage: diff "filename1" "filename2"

# MovingXor

Encrypts and decrypts a binary file. You can encrypt a file with an 8 or more character long password. Decrypts the file with the very same method by passing the encrypted file. 

Usage: xor2 "filename" "password"

The difference between the encrypted and decrypted files should be at least 99.5%.

One letter difference in the password should cause no major similarities.
